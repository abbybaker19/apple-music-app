created products.service.ts with base and endpoint URLs to connect to my databse

added database entries on my firebase for each product listed in mock product list for a total of 6 entries

added ngOnInit interface to home-layout.component.ts
    removed dependency on mock_product_list.ts from the constructor in home-layout.component.ts so it uses the backend now
    added a print statement to the console that says "Fetching product data"
    added a print statement that prints the entire data array to the console
    used a for loop to print each entry of the data to the console
